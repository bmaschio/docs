## Invoking web services

 Unfortunately the "Global Weather Service" used in this page is no longer available. Except that, all examples in this page are working and up-to-date

Jolie can be used to invoke web services.

Let us exemplify it by invoking the Global Weather Service, provided by [www.webservicex.net](http://www.webservicex.net), whose [WSDL](http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl) document can be accessed at the URL [http://www.webservicex.net/globalweather.asmx?WSDL](http://www.webservicex.net/globalweather.asmx?WSDL).

## Request the service interface from the WSDL

To invoke a web service's operation, we need to create a compatible Jolie interface. To do that we exploit the tool [wsdl2jolie](https://jolielang.gitbook.io/docs/web-services/wsdl2jolie), which is part of the Jolie trunk installation.

We run the command:

`wsdl2jolie http://www.webservicex.net/globalweather.asmx?WSDL > myWS_jolieDocument.iol`

that extracts from the WSDL a compatible Jolie interface to invoke the web service. The newly created interface is stored in myWS\_jolieDocument.iol file.

Let us open the interface file and delete its first line, which is the comment `Retrieving document at 'http://www.webservicex.net/globalweather.asmx?WSDL'.`.

## Call the web service

Once we stored the Jolie interface of the web service, we can invoke its operations by including its interface definition file in a Jolie program:

```text
include "myWS_jolieDocument.iol"
include "string_utils.iol"
include "xml_utils.iol"
include "console.iol"

main
{
    with( request ) {
        .CityName = "Rimini";
        .CountryName = "Italy"
    };
    GetWeather@GlobalWeatherSoap( request )( response );
    r = response.GetWeatherResult;
    r.options.includeAttributes = true;
    xmlToValue@XmlUtils( r )( v );
    valueToPrettyString@StringUtils( v )( s );
    println@Console( s )()
}
```

Since the web service returns a message formed by a single tag `<GetWeatherResult>`, which contains an XML document as a string, we have to exploit the `xml_utils.iol` library to transform the string into a Jolie value by means of the operation `xmlToValue`.

## Exposing web services

Jolie services can be exposed as web services as well.

Let us consider the following Jolie service which returns the address of a person identified by his name and his surname:

```text
include "console.iol"
include "string_utils.iol"

execution{ concurrent }

type Name: void {
    .name: string
    .surname: string
}

type FaultType: void {
    .person: Name
}

type GetAddressRequest: void {
    .person: Name
}

type Address: void {
    .country: string
    .city: string
    .zip_code: string
    .street: string
    .number: string
}

type GetAddressResponse: void {
    .address: Address
}

interface MyServiceInterface {
RequestResponse:
    getAddress( GetAddressRequest )( GetAddressResponse )
        throws NameDoesNotExist( FaultType )
}

inputPort MyServiceSOAPPort {
    Location: "socket://localhost:8001"
    Protocol: soap
    Interfaces: MyServiceInterface
}

main {
    getAddress( request )( response ) {
        valueToPrettyString@StringUtils( request )( s );
        println@Console( "Received:" + s )();
        if (  request.person.name == "Homer" &&
            request.person.surname == "Simpsons" ) {
            with( response.address ) {
                .country = "USA";
                .city = "Springfield";
                .zip_code = "01101";
                .street = "Evergreen Terrace";
                .number = "742"
            }
        } else {
            with( fault.person ) {
                .name = request.person.name;
                .surname = request.person.surname
            };
            throw( NameDoesNotExist, fault )
        }
    }
}
```

To expose the port `MyServiceSOAPPort` as a web service, we exploit the tool [jolie2wsdl](https://jolielang.gitbook.io/docs/web-services/jolie2wsdl) that generates the corresponding WSDL document to be attached to the file:

`jolie2wsdl -i /opt/jolie/include service.ol MyServiceSOAPPort MyWsdlDocument.wsdl`

Once generated the WSDL file is to be attached within the declaration of the inputPort:

```jolie
inputPort MyServiceSOAPPort {
    Location: "socket://localhost:8001"
    Protocol: soap {
        .wsdl = "./MyWsdlDocument.wsdl";
        .wsdl.port = "MyServiceSOAPPortServicePort"
    }
    Interfaces: MyServiceInterface
}
```
